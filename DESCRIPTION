Title: Higher Order Mutual Information Approximation for Feature Selection
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Krzysztof Gajowniczek
Maintainer: Krzysztof Gajowniczek <krzysztof_gajowniczek@sggw.edu.pl>
Description: A higher order Mutual Information (MI) based approximation technique. 
    Instead of producing a single list of features, method produces a ranked collection of feature subsets that maximizes MI, 
    giving better comprehension (feature ranking) as to which features work best together when selected, 
    due to their underlying interdependent structure.
